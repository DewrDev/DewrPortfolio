# ***Drew Twells' Programming and 3D Modelling Portfolio***

**// About this project //**

This project is designed to allow me to showcase and advertise my skills in 3D Modelling and Web Development, with the hopes that it'll help me in getting hired or help other people to find and consider me for freelancing work. The portfolio mostly contains imagery of my previous (personal) productions to showcase my abilities.

At the time of writing, the project is frontend-only and does not contain any built-in features to allow for someone to get in touch with me. However, there are links to my Github and various social medias that should provide similar functionality, alongside allowing people to further explore my works. I have embedded a Google Forum into the Contact page, in the hopes that it'll at least serve as *a way* to contact me on-site.

# Pages//UX

My goal for the overall design of my site was to make accessing information relatively easy, whilst also presenting it in a way that (hopefully) represents my well; or at least looks somewhat stylish. Making something visually appealing has never been my strong point.

## Index:

This page is designed to be an initial landing page; displaying my name some details; an option to continue forwards and some social/external icons at the bottom of the page.

The background of the page consists of a Bootstrap carousel that scrolls through some example images of my past works

## Home:

Intended as a sort of secondary landing page, the Homepage is dedicated to displaying my skills and what I do, and then giving users an option to be redirected to see more content if they wish.

## Blender//3D Modelling

Probably the crown jewl for me; this page is

# Technologies//Resources

[Bootstrap (4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for finding and importing custom fonts into my project

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for Branding icons (Github; Linkedin etc.)

[Mycolorspace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23FFC0CB&sub=1) was used to generate a good color pallete for use across the whole site.

# Features

The Index page incorporates [Boostrap's Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/) feature to have scrolling images in the background

The Blender page's images all incorporate a [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) button for toggling an expanded version of the image that is clikcked on.

An instance of [Google Forms](https://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/) is implemented into my Contact page, just below a contact information box to provide an on-site solution to contacting me without having to leave or go through the hastle of emailing me.

# Testing

I feel as though whilst not fully complete, this site overall does a good job of showcasing some of the work I've produced with Blender, alongside the other websites I've developed for clients/other purposes. I believe the Index works well as a landing page; introducing me well, whilst also breifly and subtly showcasing some of my work in the background.

# Deployment

This project was deployed using GIT (Gitkraken client) and Github pages, which allows for my github respository to be publically viewed and updated with ease. Every time I push a commit to Github, the changes and new content are almost instantaneously viewable on my Github pages site. I've ensured to title my landing page "index.html" to ensure that the page loads, as Index.html is typically the first page to be loaded upon visiting a site.

# Credits

## Content

All content found in the "About me" and "Blender" pages was created by me.

## Media

All images found on the Blender page (which can also be seen on other pages) were created by me, using Blender v2.8; the free and open-source 3D modelling software.

## Acknowledgements

The responsiveness of the Index page's background carousel comes from a great deal of help from my Mentor
