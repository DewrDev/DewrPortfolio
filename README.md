***Drew Twells' User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project***

*// About this project //*

This project is designed to allow me to showcase and advertise my skills in 3D Modelling and Web Development, with the hopes that it'll help me in getting hired or help other people to find and consider me for freelancing work.

At the time of writing, the project is frontend-only and does not contain any built-in features to allow for someone to get in touch with me. However, there are links to my Github and various social medias that should provide similar functionality, alongside allowing people to further explore my works.
