***Drew Twells' User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project***

**// About this project //**

This project is designed to allow me to showcase and advertise my skills in 3D Modelling and Web Development, with the hopes that it'll help me in getting hired or help other people to find and consider me for freelancing work.

At the time of writing, the project is frontend-only and does not contain any built-in features to allow for someone to get in touch with me. However, there are links to my Github and various social medias that should provide similar functionality, alongside allowing people to further explore my works.

This project was deployed using GIT (Gitkraken) and Github pages, which allows for my github respository to be publically viewed and updated with ease.

**// Pages //**

*Index:*

This page is designed to be an initial landing page; displaying my name some details; an option to continue forwards and some social/external icons at the bottom of the page.

The background of the page consists of a Bootstrap carousel that scrolls through some example images of my past works

*Home:*

Intended as a sort of secondary landing page, the Homepage is dedicated to displaying my skills and what I do, and then giving users an option to be redirected to see more content if they wish.



**// Technologies used //**

[Bootstrap Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/) for index page image slideshow.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for finding and importing custom fonts into my project

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for Branding icons (Github; Linkedin etc.)

[Mycolorspace]{https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23FFC0CB&sub=1) was used to generate a good color pallete for use across the whole site.
